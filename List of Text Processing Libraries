There are various text processing tools and libraries available in Python that can be used for different text-related tasks. Here's a list of commonly used text tools in Python:

1. **NLTK** (Natural Language Toolkit): A comprehensive library for natural language processing. It provides various functionalities like tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, and more.

2. **spaCy**: An industrial-strength library for natural language processing. It offers fast and efficient text processing, including tokenization, named entity recognition (NER), part-of-speech (POS) tagging, and dependency parsing.

3. **TextBlob**: A simple and intuitive library for text processing tasks, such as noun phrase extraction, sentiment analysis, tokenization, and POS tagging. It is built on top of NLTK.

4. **Gensim**: A library for topic modeling, document indexing, and similarity retrieval with large text collections. It provides efficient implementations of popular algorithms like Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).

5. **Pattern**: A web mining and natural language processing library. It offers various functionalities such as tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, sentiment analysis, and web mining capabilities.

6. **Scikit-learn**: A general-purpose machine learning library that includes text processing functionality. It provides tools for feature extraction, text vectorization (e.g., TF-IDF), and classification algorithms for text categorization.

7. **NLTK-Contrib**: An extension package for NLTK that includes additional resources and functionalities, such as wordnet, WordNet similarity measures, and corpus readers for various text datasets.

8. **PyTorch-Transformers**: A library for state-of-the-art natural language processing using deep learning models like BERT, GPT, and Transformer-XL. It allows fine-tuning and inference using pre-trained models.

9. **Stanford CoreNLP**: A suite of natural language processing tools developed by Stanford NLP Group. It includes tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, dependency parsing, and more.

10. **PyText**: A library built on PyTorch for natural language processing and deep learning. It provides tools for text classification, entity recognition, and intent detection.

These are just a few examples of text tools available in Python. Depending on your specific task and requirements, you may find other libraries and tools that suit your needs.
